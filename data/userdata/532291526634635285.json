Many things are foreign to her due to the fact that she is not from Yaretza. She prefers peace over violence, and due to her timidness, may not fight back if provoked alone. Incapable of making choices alone.",

She was part of the royal family, as her mother was a sister of the king's daughter. She lived with her parents, and brother. \n\nHowever, cruel figures that I'm too lazy to describe right now arrived to invade. Most of the royal family was killed, and that includes her parents. 3 others escaped, herself, her brother and the king's daughter.\n\nThe three were separated, both having escaped in separate ''Capsules''. Her capsule crash-landed on the <#833106074659454986> of Yaretza, and was discovered by the group.",

She may be a bit flirtatious, but in a more of a teasing manner. She also has varying amount of scars across her body, abiet quite hard to see except a few on her face.",
                "backstory": "Once a simple Raccoon in nature, with the height of 3'7'', she was captured by deranged scientists and put through many experiments that have actually caused her to be the species she is now. While there in the laboratory, she was tasked, among other things to stay alive, to watch over a small creature, later known as Lanagu. She would have made many good memories with the young boy until she was forced to partake in an experiment that forced her body to be in a smaller form than it naturally was. She wouldn't be able to naturally age to be older, unable to smell or taste anything, but her eyes can pierce through the darkest rooms naturally possible. She, despite not having been that acquainted with Lanagu much, tried her best to keep Lan from suffering much from their hands, but there was a point where she couldn't take anything. On the day that Lanagu escaped, she was there to help the male retreat away from the lab. The rest is all just a mystery at that point. \n\n",
