Wish in this instance was born in a japanese-styled village, where citizens desperately needed safety and evasion would've allowed for that. He had a simple life going through, helping out in need, but the life simply could not last for so long, despite it going for over 500 years. The reason why Wish managed to end up in Yaretza is unknown. Many people over there speculate that as the connection of upper forces, which are defined in the ``Mythology of Ventrah``.",
