Many things are foreign to her due to the fact that she is not from Yaretza. She prefers peace over violence, and due to her timidness, may not fight back if provoked alone. Incapable of making choices alone.",
            "backstory": "Valoria is a tanuki from space, hailing from a once extravagant planet called Cosmaria. She was part of the royal family, as her mother was a sister of the king's daughter. She lived with her parents, and brother. \n\nHowever, cruel figures that I'm too lazy to describe right now arrived to invade. Most of the royal family was killed, and that includes her parents. 3 others escaped, herself, her brother and the king's daughter.\n\nThe three were separated, both having escaped in separate ''Capsules''. Her capsule crash-landed on the <#833106074659454986> of Yaretza, and was discovered by the group.",

As Exetior got older and Yrma's tyranny ended he started living alongside other Netherians as 'a demon from a far off land' until IIL's arrival.\nIIL, a god of light, despised darkness in all forms and erased all followers of darkness who dared to oppose him, starting from the human village where Exetior spent his childhood (they welcomed Exetior and demons are beings of darkness, so IIL considered the villagers followers of darkness).\nOutraged, Exetior took his family and fought IIL, but his family ended up killed by the current king of demons, Sark, who was trying to trick IIL and use him to gain more power. Defeated Exetior ran away to hell's deserts where he met the soul demon Negagen. After eventually killing IIL alongside the other demons he is now known by many as the new king of demons and he now makes sure that no demons attacks our realm, and kills any that does.",

Unlike his flamboyant and loud brother, Sans is laid-back and pretty lazy. One day, a human child named Frisk showed up in the Underground. When they entered Snowdin for the first time, Sans was there to meet them. Sans told them about Papyrus, who hoped to capture a human to become a member of the Underground's Royal Guard, and asked if Frisk would show themself to Papyrus just to make him happy to see a human. Frisk agreed, and while Papyrus didn't capture them, Frisk befriended the skeleton brothers. However, Sans still hides several secrets and a large amount of power underneath his laziness, being the one who killed the sentient flower Flowey more times than any monster.",

While Papyrus' were usually easy to dodge, Sans can summon large groups of them easily and with great speed, making them harder to predict and dodge by comparison. Sans can also summon blue bones that only damage people if they're moving when they touch the bones.\n\nSoul Manipulation: Blue Mode: Another of the skeleton brothers' signature attack, Blue Mode grants Sans the ability to make enemy souls affected by gravity. While affected by Blue Mode, enemies have their movement heavily restricted, and are only able to jump to move. Sans can also use this to telekinetically lift and move his opponent, letting him slam them around with his mind.\n\nKarma: A side effect of Sans' attacks, Karmic Retribution acts as poison for the soul, whittling down an enemy's health once Sans hits them. While it only drains a little at a time, it's drain increases based on how many sins the opponent has committed.\nTeleportation: Somehow, Sans obtained the ability to teleport, which he often uses as a shortcut to get places quicker. However, in battle, Sans uses it to move his foe straight into a new attack once his old one ends, making him far more unpredictable.",

She may be a bit flirtatious, but in a more of a teasing manner. She also has varying amount of scars across her body, abiet quite hard to see except a few on her face.",
            "backstory": "Once a simple Raccoon in nature, with the height of 3'7'', she was captured by deranged scientists and put through many experiments that have actually caused her to be the species she is now. While there in the laboratory, she was tasked, among other things to stay alive, to watch over a small creature, later known as Lanagu. She would have made many good memories with the young boy until she was forced to partake in an experiment that forced her body to be in a smaller form than it naturally was. She wouldn't be able to naturally age to be older, unable to smell or taste anything, but her eyes can pierce through the darkest rooms naturally possible. She, despite not having been that acquainted with Lanagu much, tried her best to keep Lan from suffering much from their hands, but there was a point where she couldn't take anything. On the day that Lanagu escaped, she was there to help the male retreat away from the lab. The rest is all just a mystery at that point. \n\n",

But one day, there was some sort of curse that hit Merlin in the middle of a play, which caused his spirit to enter the mask. Then the mask had risen, gained some shadows around it, then it came to life. as soon as the mask figured out what was happening, it started its evil things. it was soon revealed during an evil scream that the mask was Meran. Meran had came to life by a curse, with Merlin seemingly gone out of nowhere. People had suspected that Merlin is stuck in this mask.\n\n",

He didn't get to grant much, for there wasn't much for people to dream about where he was born, so he had to move places. He didn't find much luck but only 100 years later he found a small village on alpine mountains that needed a lot of help. He was of great use there, and he was happy the way he was.
