If you use it with no arguments, you'll get information about what each stat is for; I'm here to tell you about how characters here work in general!\n\nCharacters in Blossom Battler can be used for **battle**... well mostly battle. They can grow trust to other characters, have pets help... and more! Let's get started with the biggest parts.",

				"text": "Stats are crucial. They WILL make or break a character. They WILL affect their playstyle. They WILL affect their usefulness. Arguably, these are the most important part of a character. Here are some reccomendations:\n**Healers** are usually magic based with average endurance & HP.\n**Physical Attackers** come in 3 kinds, __Hard-Hitting__, __Average__ and __Agile__. __Hard-Hitting__ **Physical Attackers** usually have high endurance and HP, with less MP. Further down, they become faster and have less endurance.\n**Magic Attackers** are usually focused on __one element__, with another as a backup. The main element is often __stronger__ than the backup element. They can also be __Hard-Hitting__, __Average__ or __Agile__. Please read the next page to figure out how to keep your characters balanced.",

Every skill has an **element**, **power**, **cost**, and **accuracy**. The rest is extra things that make them different to others, like hit count, critical hit chance, and other things. You can register your own skills with 'rpg!registerskill', 'rpg!registerstatus' and 'rpg!registerpassive'. You can use all 3 with no arguments to learn more. You can give a character a skill with 'rpg!learnskill' and 'rpg!replaceskill'",

Yeah I made it just now!\nOverstatting is giving a character... say, __high endurance__ when they **don't need it**, or __high agility__ when they **shouldn't have it**. It's annoying, makes then undefeatable, and removes the whole point of *challenge* in your battles!
