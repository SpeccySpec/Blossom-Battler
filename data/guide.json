This number gradually increase as you level up, and when added to **Base MP**, cannot exceed 65.\n*<Num: Base MP>* This is the same as **Base HP**, but for **MP**, or **Magic Points**.

They WILL affect their usefulness. Arguably, these are the most important part of a character. Here are some reccomendations:\n\n**Healers** are usually magic based with average endurance & HP. They usually profess in one or two elements, and have healing skills.\n\n**Physical Attackers** come in 3 kinds, __Hard-Hitting__, __Average__ and __Agile__. __Hard-Hitting__ **Physical Attackers** usually have high endurance and HP, with less MP. Further down, they become faster and have less endurance.\n\n**Magic Attackers** are usually focused on __one element__, with another as a backup. The main element is often __stronger__ than the backup element. They can also be __Hard-Hitting__, __Average__ or __Agile__. *Please read the next page to figure out how to keep your characters balanced.*",
